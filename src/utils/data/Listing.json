    "notes":"The cafe next door is one of the best & most popular breakfast/brunch cafes in Melbourne which can mean there can be people waiting outside the atrium entry in the mornings and early afternoons. The apartment is set back from the street so this does not affect privacy or security of guests. There are many amazing breakfast options at the nearby Cafes but if you want to eat at the apartment we provide milk, cereal, muesli, fruit, tea, coffee & hot chocolate. We also have oil, butter, spreads, sauces if you want to cook. We provide umbrellas, a hair dryer & some toys for kids, so if you want to pack lighter you can keep this in mind."
